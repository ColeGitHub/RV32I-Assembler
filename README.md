# RISC-V 32-Bit Base Integer Instruction Set Assembler

The VM is in c, but as much as I'd like to keep it all in the family I don't want to go through the hassle of building everything to parse strings in c.  I'm attempting in python because "use what you know" and I don't feel like learning perl.
